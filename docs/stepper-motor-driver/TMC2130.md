# TMC2130

The TMC2130 is a popular stepper motor driver known for its quiet operation and advanced features. It is widely used in 3D printers, CNC machines, and other applications requiring precise motor control.

## SPI Interface

The TMC2130 communicates via the SPI (Serial Peripheral Interface) protocol. This allows for high-speed data transfer and the ability to configure various parameters of the driver.
To switch the TMC2130 V1.1 into SPI mode:

- unsolder the `R5` resistor on the driver board (red rectangle in the image).
- solder `CFG4` to `GND` (purple rectangle in the image).
- solder `CFG5` to `VIO` (pink rectangle in the image).
